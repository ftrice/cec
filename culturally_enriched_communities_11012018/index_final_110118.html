            recognize the potential that lies within each individual and thereby, include spaces that support diverse
            ways of living and being in the world, contributing to the prosperity and well-being of all people.</p>

        <p class="main-content">The state of Minnesota consistently ranks among the top 10 states in the country in
            terms of quality of life, based on well being indicators such as employment rates, education, income,
            safety,
            health, environment, civic engagement, accessibility to services, and housing (Hess & Frohlich, 2014). In
            parallel, the Greater Minneapolis and St Paul (MSP) region is noted among the country’s most innovative
            cities, for
            transportation infrastructure and economic development, programs to help immigrants start businesses and
            artists buy real estate as well as public health efforts (Eugenios, Hargreaves, & Rawlins, 2014). The MSP
            region has also been named by the researchers at Parenting Magazine as one of the top five places in the
            country to raise a family (Schmidt, n.d.). And, with over 180 parks within its boundaries, Minneapolis holds
            the title of the Nation’s best park system (The Trust for Public Land, 2015) and is ranked as one of the top
            biking cities in the country, with 92 miles of on-street bikeways and 85 miles of off-street bikeways (City
            of Minneapolis, 2015). The arts scene follows suit--the MSP region is second only to New York City in live
            theater per capita and is the third-largest theater market in the United States.</p>
        <p class="main-content">Positioning the state for a vibrant and prosperous future is tied to demographic
            projections that by 2040, close to 40% of Minnesota’s
            population will be people of color, many of them international immigrants
            (Metropolitan Council, 2012). In 2013, only about 18.1% of Minnesota residents were people of color versus
            37.4% at the national</p>
        <p class="main-content">Although Minnesota enjoys high ranks in many quality of life indicators, it also
            experiences disparities in health, education, and income between whites and people of color. Given that a
            diverse population is key to economic and cultural vitality, designers, planners, policy makers, housing
            developers, neighborhood organizers, and others who are striving to unravel how to integrate the state’s
            social, economic, cultural, environmental, and technological resources face multiple questions:</p>
        <p class="main-content">How can Minnesota attract and retain a diverse population?</p>
        <p>
        <ul class="main-content">
            <li> How can communities support diverse needs and nurture in residents a feeling of value and commitment?
            </li>
            <li>In what ways can stereotypes and barriers for the creation of
                healthy and thriving communities break-down?
            </li>
            <li>How can design support culturally diverse businesses and
                development of homes and neighborhoods that support
                diverse ways of living?
            </li>
            <li>What kind of design interventions can create forums for
                public engagement that tap a community’s diversity and
                support health and well-being? And,
            </li>
            <li>How can the area’s multiculturalism be translated into
                income-generating opportunities?
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="main-content">Culturally Enriched Communities are an inherent part of planning processes that
            strengthen an area’s ability
            to plan for the growth in diversity in ways that can position the region to rank among the best in world
            while improving upon the indicators of uneven disparities. Culturally Enriched Communities include
            environments that support diverse ways of living. Recognizing the potential that lies within each individual
            and group and how places, both public and private, can impact one’s ability to be the best that they can be,
            Culturally Enriched Communities allow for the creation of municipalities that can contribute to the
            prosperity and well-being of all people. The creation of Culturally Enriched Communities relies on planners,
            policy leaders, housing developers, and others who feel an obligation to understand those they are working
            with and are interested in the lives of others.</p>
        <p class="main-content">These decision makers recognize that people construct meaning in life through different
            ways, that is, how
            they cook, what they eat, what they wear, how they socialize, how they speak, how they pray, and how they
            play is diverse. Diverse ways of living are outcomes of numerous factors including distinct ethnic, racial,
            and national backgrounds, histories, religions, incomes, ages, gender, abilities, and circumstances. As a
            result, the design of public and private spaces must be adaptable and flexible, able to be easily adjusted
            to the multiplicity of lifestyles and needs that our region’s future will hold.</p>
        <p class="main-content">When Principles of Culturally Enriched Communities are applied to a home, it could mean
            designing a kitchen so that it can be used as an open or closed space with built-in adaptability that would
            not require expensive remodeling to accommodate cooking practices. In a public space, these Principles could
            translate into signage in different languages and gathering areas that bring people together and allow for
            connections to form and stereotypes to break.</p>
        <p class="main-content">Professionals working toward Culturally Enriched Communities are willing to move beyond
            the basics, the comfortable, and the familiar to understand the people they are working with as individuals
            who change and evolve as they move through their lives. These professionals consider the impact of the
            designed environment on the construction of marginalization and difference — from limiting the types of
            foods one can eat, to the relationships one can form, the dress he/she can wear, traditions the family can
            practice and pass down, and aspirations for the future. As a result, these community building development
            programs are committed to the eight Principles of Culturally Enriched
            Communities and in turn, they:</p>
        <p>
        <ol class="main-content">
            <li>Foster partnerships and create synergies among stakeholders that range from policy makers, designers,
                and planners to business and community leaders, institutions, and community members.
            </li>
            <li>Use community engagement to strengthen the values and unique character
                of a given region and community at levels that include homes, neighborhoods, cities, the
                region, and the state.
            </li>
            <li>Bridge the local and the global, enabling residents to retain their global connections and
                build economically thriving communities.
            </li>
            <li>Celebrate the diverse histories, traditions, backgrounds, and meaning-making practices of the
                many people that comprise a community.
            </li>
            <li>Create opportunities for people of diverse backgrounds to interact with each other in
                meaningful ways, helping break down stereotypes and challenge assumptions.
            </li>
            <li>Support the health and well-being of everyone, accounting for the diverse ways by which
                humans cook, eat, sleep, socialize, dress, pray, recreate, exercise, etc. and for the needs of
                people of all ages, races, abilities, ethnic backgrounds, and socio-economic status.
            </li>
            <li>Strengthen job and educational opportunities that bring about equality and social justice
                and enhance the economic prospects of an area.
            </li>
            <li>Recognize that an open mind is crucial for innovation to flourish. This often implies exploring
                new ideas and new ways of doing things.
            </li>

            <ol>
                <li>Consider choice Effective planning for the future cannot take place without acknowledging the
                    multiple ways by which people construct meaning in their lives. Often, those choices are bounded
                    and limited as a result of factors such as health, income, and educational disparities;
                    stereotypes; access to opportunities, and circumstances, all of which are impacted by the built
                    environment.
                </li>
                <li>Understand diverse perspectives Time, energy, and funds need to be devoted to capturing diverse
                    perspectives and experiences - from policy makers to community members who are immersed in the
                    problem/issue on hand. Rethinking where expertise lies is an instrumental part of this process.
                </li>
                <li>Develop plans and policies In developing plans and policies, account for the complex and
                    multi-dimensional perspectives identified. These must be flexible and adaptable to accommodate
                    multiple uses and users.
                </li>
                <li>Act as agents of change The built environment can be a medium for challenging assumptions and
                    creating dialogues about the creation of communities where everyone can thrive.
